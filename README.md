# resume
Résumé in HTML with Web Components

## A little tale
I wanted to update my résumé, but text editors were limiting my creativity and expression. :confused:

I just figured I'd do it in HTML + CSS, after all, I'd have more control.
Then I started suffering from lack of power in styling and installed SCSS. :pensive:

Soon after I was missing scoped styles and Hot Module Replacement, or at least Hot Reload.
Obviously I couldn't setup Webpack alone without a proper testing framework, so Jest it is. :hushed:

But I wasn't going to use JavaScript at all, was I?
Well I guess since I have all the setup now, might as well...
and since we're doing JS, let's go ahead and improve it with TypeScript. :sweat_smile:

Whoa now I have this awesome setup and I won't be using any of it...
what if I tried writing my own Web Components, from spec, without any framework? :sunglasses:

Geez, now I know why there are so many frameworks out there...
let me code just a few helpers and a Webpack loader to make my life easier...
oh hey, now I can't test anything anymore! On to refactoring! :stuck_out_tongue:

Since this is pretty much a project now, might as well put it on Github, setup Travis and Firebase.
Hmm there was this Coveralls thing I was meaning to give a try, why not now? :satisfied:

:running:

Three days later, I can finally start doing what I wanted to in the first place. :+1:

I guess that's pretty showing of who I am, even more than my résumé could ever point out.
I cannot stand doing anything inefficiently. :confounded:

I will always find a way to improve upon processes and tools.
There's nothing I love more than learning something different to solve a new problem. :smile:

A few days from now I will probably have, as the saying goes, built a bazooka to kill an ant. :rocket: :ant: 

## Goal
- To build a résumé that looks good, first and foremost, as a .pdf file. If Chrome can render it so that I can print a one pager I'm good
- Secondly, learning about Web Components without framework guardrails
- Thirdly, incrementally building on the résumé so that perhaps it can also be portfolio
- Fourhtly, inject result into a more complete personal web page
- Lastly, if results are good, ~~mayhaps I've just built yet another Web Component framework~~ --nope, lit-html and lit-element are lit indeed
