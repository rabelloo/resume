Résumé in HTML with Web Components

## A little tale (from past 2018 me)

I wanted to update my résumé, but text editors were limiting my creativity and expression. :confused:

I just figured I'd do it in HTML + CSS, after all, I'd have more control.
Then I started suffering from lack of power in styling and installed SCSS. :pensive:

Soon after I was missing scoped styles and Hot Module Replacement, or at least Hot Reload.
Obviously I couldn't setup Webpack alone without a proper testing framework, so Jest it is. :hushed:

But I wasn't going to use JavaScript at all, was I?
Well I guess since I have all the setup now, might as well...
and since we're doing JS, let's go ahead and improve it with TypeScript. :sweat_smile:

Whoa now I have this awesome setup and I won't be using any of it...
what if I tried writing my own Web Components, from spec, without any framework? :sunglasses:

Geez, now I know why there are so many frameworks out there...
let me code just a few helpers and a Webpack loader to make my life easier...
oh hey, now I can't test anything anymore! On to refactoring! :stuck_out_tongue:

Since this is pretty much a project now, might as well put it on Github, setup Travis and Firebase hosting.
Hmm there was this Coveralls thing I was meaning to give a try, why not now? :satisfied:

:running:

Three days later, I can finally start doing what I wanted to in the first place. :+1:

I guess that's pretty representative of who I am, even more than a résumé ever could convey.
I cannot stand doing anything inefficiently. :confounded:

I will always find a way to improve upon processes and tools.
There's nothing I love more than solving a problem while learning something new. :smile:

I probably have, as the saying goes, built a bazooka to kill an ant. :rocket: :ant:

## Goal

- To build a résumé that looks good, first and foremost, as a .pdf file
- To learn about Web Components without framework guardrails
- If results are good, ~~perhaps I've just built yet another Web Component framework~~ --nvm, there are much stronger options out there nowadays

## Note from future me (year 2025)

At the time, the tools I used were bleeding edge and modern alternatives were not yet available or popular.
It was definitely a good exercise, and I'm proud of past me.
Some of the decisions I made back then still hold, and a small amount I'd still make again today.
However, today there are many better tools off the shelf that acomplish much more with much less effort.
Building an actual portfolio website for myself is long overdue, but for the time being I find this resume/CV quite sufficient in demonstrating my ambition.
